## Model
- Datasets used to train the model
- Domain A - CelebA
- Target Domain (Domain B)- Anime face dataset from kaggle [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset)
[Link to .pth file (trained model for 18 epochs)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Wvy4qm3OO8NC8-c7M3nmwcDUsAtgsHc/view?usp=sharing)
- Considered only 1000 images in each domain for training the model.
